# Solver:

First, you need to download CURENT VERSION NodeJS (18.x).
- https://nodejs.org/en

You can host solving node on linux vps or windows RDP.

On Linux; run "bash linux.sh". on the script foler.
On windows; Run "install.bat" and then run.bat on the same folder.

Then, put your solver licence key on config.json.
You are ready !

# Email:
Choice 1 | API: Hotmailbox.me.
Choice 2 | API: Kopeechka.
Choice 3 | IMAP: You can buy good domain name, not .xyz shit..

# Generator:
You need Windows RDP/VPS for the moment.
Linux support will comming soon.

# Proxies:
I think the best are: proxiware.com.
You need sticky session.
If proxies are ip-whitelisted please whitelist node01.proxies.gay and node02.proxies.gay ip (get them by runing ping on the DNS)
